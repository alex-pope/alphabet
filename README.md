alphabet
========

A simple type-and-say "web app" that I made for my three-year-old daughter.

Note: I have yet to record my own audio files or find creative commons audio files. To use, make a directory containing Aa.wav to Zz.wav files. Change alphabet.js to reflect desired file format (.mp3, .ogg).

TODO: Add audio files, preferable .mp3 or other compressed media.
